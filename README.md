# API testing with Cypress using Swagger documentation

Hello, and welcome to my Github page! I created this repo to demonstrate simple examples of API testing using Cypress. These tests are based on the swagger documentation for the demo site called Petstore: https://petstore.swagger.io/

# Installation

3. Launch Cypress runner by entering ```npx cypress open``` in your terminal.
4. In the Cypress runner UI, click on the ```petstore-api-tests.cy.js``` spec to run the tests. Enjoy!
